This directory tree contains user examples.

After installing CRTS, and putting crts_radio in your PATH, we recommend
copying this whole directory tree to some place in your home directory,
and then run "make" to build the difference example plug-ins and then
run/edit/run some of the example script programs like so:


make


export CRTS_MODULE_PATH=$PWD


crts_radio\
 -f Stdin\
 -f Stdout
 < /dev/urandom | hexdump -v


uhd_fft -f 915.0e6 -s 10.5e6 --args addr=192.168.10.3
