This directory provides scripts that install software packages that CRTS
depends on.  You need to run ../bootstrap before using these scripts.

Each package is in a different directory.  We made an effort to configure
all of the packages for use by CRTS.  All of these packages are can by
built and installed from GitHub source with the git tags that are listed
in default_prefixes, or (overridden) in prefixes if found.

Some of the package versions may be newer than what is available from APT
(the Debian package management system) repositories.  Hence this directory
exists.


run: "sudo ./apt-getDependencies.bash" to install packages that are
requirements on Debian or Ubuntu systems.

Instructions: 

  cp default_prefixes prefixes
  
  Edit the file prefixes to set your installation prefix directories to
  suit your preferences.

  For each package:

  cd PACKAGE_DIR && make && make install && cd ..

      or

  Just run make from this directory (this may take a while):

    make download && make && make install
