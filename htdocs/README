All the files in this directory and subdirectories can be "seen" from the
web.  Put another way, this is the "root" directory of the static files
that are served via HTTP GET via the NodeJS program crts_server.  The
crts_server program also uses the WebSockets protocol and in the future
will use the WebRTC protocol (as of Mon, Jun 11 2018 it does not).

On many web server systems this directory would be named /var/www/htdocs,
but that does not work for our development scheme, since we require that
this software not require a root user installation, and we also require
that we have a completely encapsulated installation in a single "prefix"
directory tree.   In addition we also require that (in the default
installation) the directory/file structure in the source be the same as
the installed software package, but with some development files missing;
for example we don't install most make files and most C++ files.  There
may be options to install some files not in the "prefix" directory tree.

As a consequence of this strict file structure we can run all the CRTS
programs from the source directory without installing it.  That saves a
lot of development and user time, and makes guessing the path to source
files easy.
