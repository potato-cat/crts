The libcrts library is not intended to provide CRTS user interfaces.  The
libcrts library is used to override bad behavior of the libuhd.so library,
which writes crap to stdout.  Libraries should not write to stdout or
stderr, it's considered a very bad practice.  libuhd.so writes to stdout
in it's library constructor, which is very bad behavior for a library.

We added linking "bin/crts_radio" with libcrts.so in order to override
this bad behavior.  This fix had to be a linked shared library in order to
make the "override" code get executed before the libuhd.so constructor
code.  Using LD_PRELOAD was not as good of an option, because that would
make programs require a separate fork and execute bootstrap step, or a
shell wrapper (which is also a fork and execute bootstrap step).
