TODO:

We need to get rid of X3DOM.  It does not seem to be maintained well.
Currently we have to use an out-of-date version because all newer versions
do not support elevationGrid.

In it's place we should use the WebGL which is has native support in
the browsers.  Or three.js https://threejs.org/






Classes internal to program crts_radio:


   Thread

         static global thread barrier
         static mainThread


     each Thread

         is a list of FilterModule


  FilterModule

         container for CRTSFilter

         FilterModule::input()

              1) if not different thread calls CRTSFilter::write()

            or

              2) or signals cond to thread to call CRTSFilter::write()
                 or blocks and ... if the queue is full


  Stream

         static factory of Stream
         static mutex
         static cond

    each Stream

         atomic bool isRunning

         is a factory of FilterModule

            load()   - create a FilterModule for a stream
            unload() - delete a FilterModule from a stream

         is a factory of Thread

             createThread()

             destroyThread()



How does GNUradio work:  After reading this I see that we are doing many
of the same things as GNU radio, but we have some things that are much
more efficient than GNU radio, like for example we do not require that all
blocks run in a separate thread, the blocks can share threads any way you
choose.

while ./crts_radio\
 -l sleepTest\
 -f fileIn [ --file xxx1 ]\

 -f sleepTest -f sleepTest\
 -f stdout\
 -t 0 -t 1 -t 3 -t 4\
 -c 0 2 1 3 2 4 3 4\
 > xxxx ;\
 do echo -e "\n\nSuccess\n\n" ;\
 sleep 1 ; done

 -f sleepTest\
 -f sleepTest\
 -f stdout\
 -c 0 1 0 2 1 3 2 4 3 5 4 5\

 # or with a single thread running all
