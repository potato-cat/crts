# Running this script generates the one file config.make

# This script sets up the software for a typical development
# configuration.  You are not necessarily encouraged to use this, but
# copying it and making your own local version of it is encouraged.


# We let the make files have a prefix (or PREFIX) which is an encapsulated
# installation directory, where all files that get installed are installed
# to.  There will be sub-directories created in the prefix directory like
# bin/ lib/ include/ share/ and etc/ ... (pun intended).
#
# This "prefix" idea has a history and many different manifestations.

# We try to limit all user configuration options to the one file
# ./config.make which is a GNU make file that is accessed by most other
# make files (named GNUmakefile).  If config.make is changed after files
# are generated you want to run "make clean && make" to rebuild the
# generated files that depend on these make configuration variables.
